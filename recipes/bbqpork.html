        Today, Iâ€™m going to teach you how to make super juicy and tender bbq pulled pork in your Instant Pot or pressure cooker.
        <br><br>
        This recipe is great for family dinners, office potlucks, or even throughout the week as prepped meals. It's best in the summer with a side of mac and cheese and collard greens, but can be enjoyed year-round!

            1/3 cup brown sugar
        </li>
        <li>
            4 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
        </li>
        <li>
            2 teaspoons garlic powder
        </li>
        <li>
            1 teaspoon onion powder
        </li>
        <li>
            6 hamburger buns - for serving
        </li>
    </ul> 

    <h3>
        Steps
    </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Add pork to a lightly greased pressure cooker/instant pot. Pour coca cola over the pork.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir together 2 cups bbq sauce, brown sugar, apple cider vinegar, garlic powder, and onion powder. Pour over pork. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Place lid on the pressure cooker, sliding into the locked position. Set to pressure cook for 45 minutes. Do a natural release for 10 minutes, then turn valve to the vent position. Once float valve has dropped, remove lid.
        </li>
        <li>
            Use two forks to shred pork into small chunks. Use a slotted spoon to transfer pork to a bowl (discard liquid from pressure cooker) and stir remaining 1/2 cup bbq sauce with shredded pork. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Serve pulled pork on hamburger buns. Optional sandwich toppings to take your pulled pork to the next level: mayo, extra bbq sauce, and cole slaw. 
        </li>
    </ol><br>
